The KAPA Annual Science Meeting (KASM) is a place for the extended science teams for the KAPA science surveys to gather, catch up on KAPA progress, provide feedback on KAPA hardware and tools, prepare their survey strategies, and advance their science cases.

This meeting will take place on September 8th, one day before the start of the 2021 Keck Science Meeting Meeting (KSM). The event will be held in-person at UC San Diego, with virtual attendance options available via Zoom and Slack.
Depending on California state health guidelines for COVID-19, the in-person may switch to all-virtual. Relevant links are available from the [agenda]({{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl }}/kasm2021/agenda/).


For information on travel, lodging, and dining please refer to the KSM travel page <a href="https://kecksciencemeeting.org/home/logistics/" target="_blank">here</a>. <b>Note: KASM2021 will
take place in a different location than KSM2021 at UC San Diego. KASM2021 will be held in the Science and Engineering Research Facility (SERF) room 383. </b>

KAPA and KASM are supported by the NSF and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. There are funds available to support early career researchers and KAPA science team members to travel to KASM.
