The KAPA Annual Science Meeting (KASM) is a place for the extended science teams for the KAPA science surveys to gather, catch up on KAPA progress, provide feedback on KAPA hardware and tools, prepare their survey strategies, and advance their science cases.

This meeting will take place on September 14th, one day before the start of the 2022 Keck Science Meeting Meeting (KSM). The event will be held in-person at Caltech, with virtual attendance options available via Zoom and Slack. In-person attendees will need to be vaccinated, as per the Caltech vaccine mandate.
Depending on California state health guidelines for COVID-19, the in-person may switch to all-virtual. Relevant links are available from the [agenda]({{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl }}/kasm2022/agenda/).
