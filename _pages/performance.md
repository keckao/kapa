title: "KAPA Performance"
---

As shown below, KAPA improves the Strehl ratio and sky coverage over the current AO
system from the addition of laser tomography (including a new
laser and real-time controller) and near-infrared tip-tilt
sensing. Metrics are for K-band in median seeing at 30 degree zenith
angle and 60 degree galactic latitude.
