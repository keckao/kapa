The OSIRIS [Exposure Time Calculator (ETC)](https://oirlab.ucsd.edu/osiris/etc/) and [Strehl Calculator](http://bhs.astro.berkeley.edu:8501/) can be used to help astronomers asses
the quality of OSIRIS data achievable for their given science cases. A user of the ETC has the ability to
select any configuration of OSIRIS filters and modes, as well as the intended PSF configuration. For the
Strehl calculator, a user can input zenith angle, tip-tilt star brightness, spectral type, and
intended exposure time (from the ETC) to generate a table of Strehl ratios and FWHMs as a function of filter.

The OSIRIS ETC and Strehl Calculator were developed by the UCSD Optical InfraRed Laboratory and
the KAPA Science Tools Team at UC Berkeley.
