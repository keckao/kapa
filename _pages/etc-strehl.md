The OSIRIS <a href="https://oirlab.ucsd.edu/osiris/etc/" target="_blank">Exposure Time Calculator (ETC)</a> and <a href="http://bhs.astro.berkeley.edu:8501/" target="_blank">Strehl Calculator</a> can be used to help astronomers asses
the quality of OSIRIS data achievable for their given science cases. A user of the ETC has the ability to
select any configuration of OSIRIS filters and modes, as well as the intended PSF configuration. For the
Strehl calculator, a user can input zenith angle, tip-tilt star brightness, spectral type, and
intended exposure time (from the ETC) to generate a table of Strehl ratios and FWHMs as a function of filter.

The OSIRIS ETC and Strehl Calculator were developed by the Optical InfraRed (OIR) Laboratory at
UC San Diego and the KAPA Science Tools Team at UC Berkeley.

The calculators can be found at the following links:
