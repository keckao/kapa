**Location**

KASM 2023 will be held at UC Berkeley at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/bnBQkSknWNUcoaU79">UC Berkeley Faculty Club</a>. The faculty club is a very short walk from the Astronomy Department building. <b>PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NOT THE SAME VENUE AS THE KECK SCIENCE MEETING</b>.

**Parking**

If you are driving to Berkeley in your own car or a rental, please be advised that campus parking is extremely limited and spaces fill up quickly on campus. The <a href="https://pt.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/campus_parking_map_2022.pdf">UC Berkeley parking map</a> shows the parking lots around campus, however not all of these lots allow for hourly parking or visitor parking. Please refer to the <a href="https://pt.berkeley.edu/parking/visitor-parking">parking guidelines for visitors to campus</a>. Parking lots and rates specifically for visitors are <a href="https://pt.berkeley.edu/parking/visitor-parking/lots-pricing">listed here</a>. Please note that either the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/gMqyYgfsBvkt88yd6">Stadium parking lot</a> or the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/NxADKcQv2UqkDxDD7">Underhill garage</a> are closest to the KASM 2023 venue, both about a 10 minute walk away. Lastly, if you are visiting from another UC and hold a parking pass there, UC Berkeley honors staff and faculty passes from other UC Campuses as <a href="https://pt.berkeley.edu/parking/visitor-parking/reciprocity">outlined here</a>. However, you do need to email proof of your parking permit purchase to prktrans@berkeley.edu and include your visit date and where on campus you are visiting. They will then create a permit for your visit.


**Public Transportation and Ride Sharing**

If you are planning to arrive via Public Transportation please refer to the <a href="https://pt.berkeley.edu/transit">guidelines on the UC Berkeley website here</a>. If you are planning to take an Uber or Lyft to campus, the campus has <a href="https://pt.berkeley.edu/PUZ">designated dropoff/pickup points for ride sharing apps</a>. The nearest dropoff point is the Optometry Clinic, which is a 5 minute walk from the venue. 

**Zoom**

KASM 2023 is an in person only meeting.
