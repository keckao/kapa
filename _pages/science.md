title: "KAPA Key Science Cases"
---

KAPA has four key science objectives:

* **Galactic Center**: Testing General Relativity and studying supermassive black hole interactions at the Galactic Center.
* **Dark Matter with Strongly Lensed Galaxies**: Constraining dark matter, the Hubble constant, and dark energy via strong gravitational lensing.
* **Proto-Planets**: Directly studying gas-giant protoplanets around the youngest stars.
* **Galaxy Formation and Evolution with Lensed Galaxies**: Characterizing galaxy kinematics and metallicity using rare highly magnified galaxies.
